## Reflections on Configuration Management

Configuration management is crucial for any software engineer. It allows teams to build large, complex softweare systems and tracks changes thus making it very useful for version control as well as testing. Configuraiton management addresses three issues that developers face: collaboration, preservation of integrity,and accesibility. Git is currently the most popular technology for configuration management and used in combination with GitHub it has revolutionized software development. 

One of the largest advantages to using Git is version control. Being able to control versions allows developers to track changes in the code, and allows one to backtrack if necessary. This feature alone make Git invaluable when working on larger projects. There are also advantages to storing all versions on a centralised server. The benefits of a system like this is that multiple developers can make changes, and each change can then be attributed to a specific developer. On the downside, the fact that everything is stored on a remote database means no changes can be made when that server goes down; and if the central database is lost, each client only has the current version of whatever they were working on.
