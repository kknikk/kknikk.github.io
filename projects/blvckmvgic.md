## Create, send, and recieve encrypted messages hidden Steganographically within a photo. 

This application was developed in 2016 for the purpose of learning more about concepts that interested us. Mainly, this focused on encryption and steganography. We combined RSA encryption with LSB steganogrpahy in order to hide data within a photo that a user takes. To produce quality results we found that the photos used needed to "noiser". This helped produce a final product that looked essentially identical to the original. User's are given the option to either save the altered photo, the hidden message, or to delete immediately. 

Through this project we discovered how these techniques have been used in the past and what kind of impact they can have. We also gained experience with public key cryptography.
