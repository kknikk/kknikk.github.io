## STATE OF HAWAI‘I CALLS ON PROGRAMMERS TO HELP IMPROVE GOVERNMENT
To engage the local tech community in the modernization of Hawai‘i state government, Governor David Ige and the Office of Enterprise Technology Services (ETS) will be presenting the Hawai‘i Annual Code Challenge from August 27 to September 24. Refreshments will be provided.

The purpose of the Code Challenge is to bring local talent together to develop modern tools and applications to provide enhanced government services to the public. The event will also provide opportunities for students to network and show off their skills to the public and private-sector professional communities.

## MONTH-LONG “CODE CHALLENGE” TAKES HACKATHON MODEL TO A NEW LEVEL
A first of its kind in Hawai‘i, HACC is based on the concept of a hackathon, a problem-solving event that brings together creative individuals over a set duration. Hackathons serve a variety of purposes, from exploring a new technology or programming language to encouraging economic growth through technology development, and they are often sponsored by companies, nonprofit groups, and other organizations. Rather than the traditional around-the- clock development over a single day or weekend, HACC will offer an extended period for development over one month.

The expanded month-long timeframe is being provided to encourage solutions that not only meet immediate needs and/or serve desired functions, but also are appropriately matched with technologies and platforms in use or being considered by the state, increasing viability for implementation and long-term sustainability.
