## Understanding Pain

Project for the John A. Burns School of Medicine (JABSOM) used to help doctors understand patient's pain. Doctors can track patients pain based on universal pain assesment tool. Data is stored online via Google Docs. My team and I volunteered to assist with the debugging of the application. Pain is often difficult to measure as it is subjective. The application aimed to ease this measurement by having the patient use an android tablet. Results could be stored and retrieved via Google Docs based on a patients ID.
